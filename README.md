# Janis-Verona

This project is a system of batch files that produces incremental backups your files using xcopy
then archives into password protected 7zip files sized to fit onto media.

The Archives can be safely uploaded to the public internet. 7zip passwords are strong. FLW. Each backup-archive has its own password, randomly generated by this system. A master password is set by the user (on their local device only) to retrive these passwords given in an index-file.
